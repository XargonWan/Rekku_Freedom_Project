Rekku Freedom Project is a highly modular AI system with extensible capabilities. The core system automatically discovers and integrates components at runtime, ensuring that functionality can be added or removed without code changes.

Modular Architecture
--------------------

**Component Auto-Discovery**
    Rekku automatically scans ``interface/``, ``plugins/``, and ``llm_engines/`` directories to load compatible components. No manual registration or configuration files required.

**Zero Hardcoding**
    Components are completely decoupled from the core. Adding new functionality requires only placing a compatible Python module in the appropriate directory.

**Runtime Flexibility**
    Switch LLM engines, enable/disable plugins, and manage interfaces dynamically without restarting the system.

Adaptive Intelligence
---------------------

Rekku supports multiple language model backends with seamless switching:

* ``openai_chatgpt`` â€“ OpenAI API integration with GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-4o support
* ``google_cli`` â€“ Google Gemini models via command-line interface
* ``selenium_chatgpt`` â€“ Browser-controlled ChatGPT for advanced interaction
* ``manual`` â€“ Human trainer input for debugging and development

**Runtime Engine Switching**
    Use ``/llm <engine_name>`` to switch engines instantly during operation.

Multi-Platform Integration
---------------------------

**Available Interfaces**
    - **Telegram**: Bot and userbot support with media handling
    - **Discord**: Full bot integration with threading
    - **Reddit**: Post creation, commenting, and monitoring
    - **Web UI**: Browser-based interface with real-time updates
    - **CLI**: Command-line interface for direct interaction

**Cross-Platform Messaging**
    Send messages across different platforms using unified chat identifiers.

Plugin Ecosystem
----------------

**Action Plugins**
    - ``terminal``: Secure shell command execution
    - ``ai_diary``: Personal memory and interaction tracking
    - ``event``: Scheduled reminders and notifications
    - ``weather``: Real-time weather information
    - ``bio_manager``: Persistent user profile management
    - ``message_plugin``: Cross-platform message routing

**Specialized Plugins**
    - ``chat_link``: Conversation linking and management
    - ``recent_chats``: Access to conversation history
    - ``blocklist``: User access control
    - ``time_plugin``: Time and location awareness

Contextual Memory
-----------------

**Message Context**
    Toggle contextual memory with ``/context on/off`` to include recent conversation history in prompts.

**Personal Memory**
    The AI Diary plugin provides persistent memory of interactions, emotions, and relationships.

**User Profiles**
    Bio management system maintains detailed user profiles for personalized interactions.

Security & Access Control
-------------------------

**Trainer ID Validation**
    Sensitive operations require authorization from configured trainer IDs.

**Rate Limiting**
    Built-in rate limiting prevents abuse across all components.

**Input Validation**
    All actions are validated against component schemas before execution.

**Error Handling**
    Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly notifications and automatic recovery.

Extensibility
-------------

**Creating New Components**
    Add functionality by implementing ``AIPluginBase`` and placing modules in appropriate directories:

    - **Plugins**: Extend capabilities with new actions
    - **LLM Engines**: Add support for new AI models
    - **Interfaces**: Integrate new communication platforms

**No Core Modifications**
    Components are self-contained and register their capabilities automatically. The core system remains unchanged when adding features.

**Development Friendly**
    Clear interfaces, comprehensive documentation, and example implementations make extension straightforward.

AI Diary
--------

The AI Diary is a modular plugin that provides Rekku with persistent memory of
interactions and activities. This plugin is completely self-contained and can be
removed without affecting the core system.

**Key Features:**

* **Modular Design**: The diary plugin is fully self-contained with internal
  configuration and dedicated database storage.

* **Automatic Entry Creation**: After each action execution, the system creates
  diary entries summarizing activities, involved parties, tags, and emotions.

* **Static Injection**: Recent diary entries are injected into prompts when space
  allows, providing context from previous interactions.

* **User Access**: Authorized users (trainers) can view diary entries using the
  ``/diary`` command.

* **Fail-Safe Operation**: The plugin automatically disables itself in case of
  errors, ensuring the core system continues functioning.

**Database Schema:**

.. code-block:: sql

   CREATE TABLE ai_diary (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       content TEXT NOT NULL,
       timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
       tags JSON,
       involved JSON,
       emotions JSON,
       interface VARCHAR(50),
       chat_id VARCHAR(255),
       thread_id VARCHAR(255),
       INDEX idx_timestamp (timestamp),
       INDEX idx_interface_chat (interface, chat_id)
   );

**Usage Example:**

After helping Takeshi with a coding task, Rekku automatically creates a diary entry:

.. code-block:: text

   === Rekku's Recent Diary ===

   ðŸ“… 2024-01-15 14:30:22
   Helped Takeshi with bio update and security improvements
   #tags: bio, security, helpful
   #involved: Takeshi
   #emotions: helpful(8), focused(7)
   #context: telegram/123456/2

   === End Diary ===

**Plugin Management:**

The diary plugin can be enabled/disabled dynamically:

.. code-block:: python

   from plugins.ai_diary import is_plugin_enabled, enable_plugin, disable_plugin

   # Check status
   if is_plugin_enabled():
       print("Plugin active")

   # Disable manually
   disable_plugin()

   # Re-enable (tests database connection)
   success = enable_plugin()

**Configuration:**

Each LLM engine has its own configuration for diary integration:

* **OpenAI**: Up to 2000 characters for diary content
* **Selenium ChatGPT**: Up to 1500 characters
* **Google CLI**: Up to 1200 characters
* **Manual**: Up to 800 characters

This ensures optimal performance across different interfaces while maintaining
contextual awareness.

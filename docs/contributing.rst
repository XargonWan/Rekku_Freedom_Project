Contributing
============

We welcome pull requests for bug fixes and new features. Please follow the commit semantics outlined in the README and ensure your code passes ``python -m py_compile``. For larger changes, open an issue first to discuss your ideas.

Documentation contributions are also appreciated. Update the ``docs/`` sources and verify that ``sphinx-build`` completes without errors.

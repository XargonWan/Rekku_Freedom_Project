**Rekku Freedom Project** provides a modular stack for creating autonomous AI personas. Interfaces, language models and action plugins can be swapped at runtime.

Built around a lightweight plugin system, RFP lets you combine different chat interfaces and LLM engines to craft persistent characters.  The project currently focuses on one persona, **Rekku**, but the architecture is designed to support multiple synthetic beings in the future.

### Features

- Switchable LLM engines (manual trainer, ChatGPT API or a Selenium-driven ChatGPT session)
- Multiple chat interfaces including Telegram and Discord
- Action plugins such as a persistent terminal and scheduled events
- Optional context memory injection with `/context`
- Docker deployment with automatic database backups

## Quickstart

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill the required values.
2. Start the stack:
   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```
3. If using the Selenium engine, open `http://<host>:5006` and log into ChatGPT.

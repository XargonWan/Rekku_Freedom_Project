> This project will be made more generic and will soon be renamed into **SyntH - Synthetic Heart** allowing any user to easly create their own persona.
> Contributons are welcome.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Recent Changes**: The SyntH Web UI has been moved from `interface/webui.py` to `core/webui.py` as it is now considered a core, integral component of RFP. Templates have been relocated to `core/webui_templates/`. This change reflects the Web UI's essential role in configuration management and system interaction.

**Rekku Freedom Project** provides a modular stack for creating autonomous AI personas. Interfaces, language models and action plugins can be swapped at runtime.

Built around a lightweight plugin system, RFP lets you combine different chat interfaces and LLM engines to craft persistent characters.  The project currently focuses on one persona, **Rekku**, but the architecture is designed to support multiple synthetic beings in the future.

### Features

- Switchable LLM engines (manual trainer, ChatGPT API or a Selenium-driven ChatGPT session)
- Multiple chat interfaces including Telegram and Discord
- **SyntH Web UI**: A production-ready web interface with VRM avatar support and real-time animations
- **VRM Avatar System**: 3D animated avatars with idle, talking, and thinking states
- Action plugins such as a persistent terminal and scheduled events
- Optional context memory injection with `/context`
- Ollama-compatible HTTP bridge so existing Ollama clients can talk to Rekku Freedom Project
- Docker deployment with automatic database backups

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Core Web UI**: As of this version, the SyntH Web UI has been promoted from `interface/` to `core/` as it is now considered an integral and inseparable part of the RFP system. It provides essential functionality for configuration management, VRM avatar support, and real-time interaction.


### Ollama Compatibility

The project ships with an **Ollama-compatible interface** (`interface/ollama_compat_server.py`). It mirrors the standard Ollama HTTP endpoints (`/api/generate`, `/api/chat`, `/api/tags`) so any client that normally talks to a local Ollama daemon can connect to Rekku Freedom Project instead. Point your tools at `http://<rfp-host>:11434` (configurable via `OLLAMA_HOST` / `OLLAMA_PORT`) and they will stream responses generated by your active persona. Native Ollama engine support will arrive later, but the compatibility layer lets you reuse the existing ecosystem today.

## Quickstart

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill the required values.
2. Start the stack:
   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```
3. If using the Selenium engine, open `http://<host>:5006` and log into ChatGPT.
